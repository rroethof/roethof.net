# Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions to our project! By participating, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which aims to foster a respectful and inclusive environment aligned with established open source best practices.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by filing a complaint at github@roethof.net and/or contacting a project maintainer.

We appreciate your courtesy of avoiding political questions here. Issues that are not directly related to the project itself will be closed by our community managers.

## Engaging in Our Project

We use GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you are a new contributor, see: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute)

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request, addressing (with `@...`) a suitable maintainer of this repository in the description of the pull request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, please reach out to us via email at github@roethof.net. This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal of inspiration.

## Steps to Contribute

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from other contributors on the same issue.

If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them and one of the maintainers will clarify. Clear and respectful communication is essential for successful collaboration.

## Contributing Code or Documentation

You are welcome to contribute code. content or documentation. Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the master branch and if needed, rebase to the current master branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master, you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* Ensure you sign your commits (`git commit -S -m "commit commentary`), see also [Github signing commits](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits).

* Test your changes as thoroughly as possible before you commit them. Preferably, automate your test by unit/integration tests. If tested manually, provide information about the test scope in the PR description (e.g., “Test passed: Upgrade version from 0.42 to 0.42.23.”). We strive for high-quality contributions.

* Create _Work In Progress [WIP]_ pull requests only if you need clarification or an explicit review before you can continue your work item.

* Post review:
    * If a review requires you to change your commit(s), please test the changes again.
    * Amend the affected commit(s) and force push onto your branch.
    * Set respective comments in your GitHub review to resolved.
    * Create a general PR comment to notify the reviewers that your amendments are ready for another round of review. Providing clear and constructive feedback is a key part of our review process.

## Issues and Planning

* We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests.

* Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to reproduce that issue for the assignee. Therefore, contributors should use but aren't restricted to the issue template provided by the project maintainers. For guidance on writing effective reports, consider common open source practices.

* When creating an issue, try using one of our issue templates which already contain some guidelines on which content is expected to process the issue most efficiently. If no template applies, you can of course also create an issue from scratch.

* Please apply one or more applicable labels to your issue so that all community members are able to cluster the issues better. Effective issue management helps keep our project organized.
