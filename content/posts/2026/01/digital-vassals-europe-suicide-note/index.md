### Digital Vassals: Why the EU’s Big Mouth Is a Suicide Note

It’s January 2026, and the post-war illusion is finally collapsing.

Trump is no longer hinting or posturing. Greenland is openly discussed as an acquisition. A Special Envoy is appointed. After Venezuela, pretending this is “just rhetoric” is either dishonest or delusional. The United States has demonstrated that sovereignty is negotiable when power allows it.

Europe’s response has been predictable. Strong language. Moral outrage. Statements about international law and alliance solidarity. NATO and EU leaders line up behind Denmark and declare that Greenland’s sovereignty is non-negotiable.

Then come the threats. Talk of closing bases. Cutting power. Severing cables.

It sounds tough. It isn’t.

Europe is threatening physical retaliation while standing inside infrastructure it does not control.

### Power No Longer Lives Where Europe Thinks It Does

This is not a military imbalance problem.  
It is a control problem.

Europe does not hold escalation dominance. Washington does, without firing a shot.

The real leverage is jurisdiction over digital infrastructure. Identity systems. Control planes. Key management. Support channels. Everything required to operate a modern state.

Through the US CLOUD Act, American law reaches into systems operated by US companies regardless of where the servers sit. This does not require dramatic shutdowns or visible retaliation. It looks quieter than that.

Access becomes “legally restricted.”  
Administrative actions become unavailable.  
Support disappears behind compliance statements.

Systems may keep running.  
People lose the ability to control them.

That is not an outage.  
That is administrative paralysis.

### This Is Not Theoretical

We already know what happens when centralized infrastructure fails.

When Cloudflare, AWS, and Azure experienced major outages, governments stalled. Payments froze. Logistics broke. Healthcare systems degraded. Not because of war or sabotage, but because too much of the world depends on too few platforms.

The Broadcom takeover of VMware exposed something even more uncomfortable. Operational trust can vanish overnight when ownership changes. Contracts, certifications, and long-term planning mean nothing when incentives shift.

Centralization creates leverage.  
Jurisdiction turns leverage into power.

This is the environment Europe chose.

### Denmark’s Signal: Escaping Jurisdictional Control

Against this backdrop, Denmark’s Road Traffic Authority moving parts of its infrastructure to an open source stack is not about technology fashion or cost savings.

It is about jurisdiction.

The specific tools matter less than the direction. Denmark stepped away from ecosystems where a foreign government can silently intervene through vendors, courts, or compliance regimes. That is the core issue Europe keeps avoiding.

For decades, software was treated as procurement. Licenses were signed. Vendors were trusted. Sovereignty was assumed to be permanent and abstract. That assumption no longer survives contact with reality.

Open source is not automatically sovereign. It does not magically solve security or scale. But it removes one critical failure mode. No single foreign vendor can unilaterally revoke access, enforce policy, or mediate operation through another country’s legal system.

Code can be audited.  
Systems can be rebuilt.  
Infrastructure can run without asking permission.

That option alone changes the balance of power.

Denmark’s move matters because it proves this is possible. Not easy. Not instant. But possible. It exposes the real barrier as political fear rather than technical impossibility.

### The EU’s Grand Bluff

The EU believes rhetoric is leverage.

It isn’t.

Every threat is written on US-controlled platforms, authenticated by US-controlled identity systems, logged in US-jurisdiction clouds, and archived under US law.

After Greenland and Venezuela, the belief that “the US would never do that” is dead. But intent is no longer the point. Dependency itself is already defeat.

You do not need hostile action when the option exists. Power is exercised by the mere ability to withhold.

### Conclusion: Sovereignty Is Now a Stack Problem

America has reverted to landlord geopolitics.

The EU responded by discovering it does not own the keys to its own house.

Denmark noticed first.

In 2026, sovereignty no longer starts with borders, treaties, or summits. It starts with who controls the systems that run the state.

If you do not control:
- Your software
- Your identity systems
- Your update mechanisms
- Your operational jurisdiction

You do not control your country.

Denmark is building lifeboats.  
The rest of Europe is still arguing about flags.

And when the cloud says “we are legally unable to comply,” only one kind of system will still boot.

The one you actually own.
