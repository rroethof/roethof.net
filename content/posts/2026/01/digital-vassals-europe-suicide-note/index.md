### The Greenland Situation: A Delusion

It’s January 2026. The post-war fantasy is dead. Trump isn’t just posting. Greenland is being discussed as an acquisition target. A Special Envoy is in Copenhagen. After Venezuela, nobody thinks this is a joke. The US has shown it will rewrite sovereignty when it wants to.

Europe’s response? Moral outrage. NATO solidarity statements. Threats to close bases or cut cables. It’s a bluff. Europe is threatening physical retaliation while running on digital infrastructure it doesn’t control.

### The Hyperscaler Trap

Retaliation won’t be an explosion. It will be:
- "Support unavailable due to compliance."
- "Administrative access restricted."
- "Identity services suspended."

Systems stay up. You just can’t log in.

### We Have Seen This Before

This isn’t theory. When [Cloudflare](https://roethof.net/posts/2025/11/cloudflare-aws-azure-outages-centralization-2025/), [AWS](https://roethof.net/posts/2025/10/when-the-cloud-falls-the-world-trembles/) or Azure go down, the economy stops. Not because of bombs, but because of centralization. When [Broadcom bought VMware](https://roethof.net/posts/2025/11/vmware-is-dead-broadcom-killed-operational-trust/), we saw how fast "enterprise trust" dies when ownership changes. Centralization is leverage. Jurisdiction is power.

### Denmark’s Bunker: Why NixOS Matters

This is why Denmark’s Road Traffic Authority moving to [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is the only serious move on the board. It’s not about "open source." It’s about operational sovereignty. [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) changes the power dynamic because it is declarative. The entire system—users, services, firewalls, packages, is defined as code.

#### 1. Declarative Systems Are Auditable

- No hidden state.
- No drift.
- No vendor secrets.
- You can verify exactly what is running.

#### 2. Reproducibility Is Independence

Traditional systems rely on trusting the vendor's update channel.
[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) relies on math. Same inputs = same system. Anywhere.
If the US applies pressure, you don’t negotiate. You redeploy to hardware you control.

#### 3. Rollbacks Neutralize Weapons

Updates can be weaponized to break compliance or add backdoors.
In [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), every change is atomic. If an update is hostile, you revert instantly.

### The Verdict

America is playing landlord. Europe is realizing it doesn’t own the house. Denmark is building a lifeboat with [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). The rest of Europe is arguing about the curtains.

In 2026, if you don’t control your configuration, identity, and updates, you don’t control your country.
