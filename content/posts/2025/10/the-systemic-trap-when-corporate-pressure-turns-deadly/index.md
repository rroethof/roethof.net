**Core Message:** Burnout is not a personal failure or a passing 'winter dip'; it is a fatal symptom of a toxic, systemically flawed work culture that values output over human life. Don’t wait for your body to break before demanding change — or walking away.

My story is one of a systemic failure, not a personal one.

For years, my professional life, spanning critical roles from Linux/Ansible specialist and internal CISO to area product owner across various high-stakes public sector agencies and corporations, was a relentless, high-stakes sprint.

I was the troubleshooter, the passionate tech expert who handled crisis. The reality behind that façade was a toxic, repetitive pattern that defined nearly every role:

- **Chronic Overtime and Extreme Pressure:** The baseline was always unsustainable.  
- **Ignored Warnings:** Reports on process, workflow, and security risks were systematically dismissed.  
- **Broken Promises:** Agreed actions and support were consistently abandoned.  

The cycle after every burnout was brutal: I was told to "take it easy," quickly cleared by the occupational health service, and immediately thrown back into the deep end. There was never room for sustainable recovery; the structural conditions for healthy functioning were always missing.

I didn’t become 'cynical' — I was hollowed out by the structural conflict between my inability to say 'no' and the inhumane expectations placed upon me, especially during crucial, high-pressure IT projects (including projects related to CISO governance and the national QR verification system).

## The Breaking Point

The first symptoms weren’t just memory loss or poor concentration. They were the body’s desperate warning signals. The mind may be resilient, but the body keeps a merciless score.

In September 2024, the inevitable happened: a heart attack that required stents.

It was the undeniable proof that years of unaddressed stress and relentless pressure had physically broken me. This wasn’t a mental health issue anymore; it was a medical emergency — the direct result of an unforgiving work environment compounded by chronic conditions like obesity and Type 2 diabetes.

## The Cost of the Relentless Cycle

**No Reintegration:** After the heart attack, I was quickly pushed back to work without a proper reintegration plan — just a return to the fire.

**Cognitive Collapse:** I desperately wanted to work, but my brain refused. I jumped relentlessly from task to task, desperate to make progress, yet even the simplest duty was impossible to complete. This inability to concentrate is a constant, grinding failure.

**Constant Pain and Exhaustion:** Sleep, even with a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, offered no relief. I woke up exhausted every morning, with chronic chest pain (Tietze/Costochondritis) that made every movement heavy.

**Home as a Zero-Sum Game:** As the sole breadwinner, recovery was not an option. My partner has Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and cannot work or drive, and we have an autistic son. Every doctor’s appointment now requires a 30+ km drive to Almere or Harderwijk — public transport or taxis are technically possible, but financially untenable. Recovery is impossible when you are the only one who can drive.

The result of this constant attrition? Irritation, guilt, and a deep, existential fear: How long can my heart hold out? What if I’m not here for my family?

## The Final Verdict

My body now carries the evidence of multiple burnouts over ten years, a heart attack, and chronic pain. It speaks a language of absolute necessity. This is not about 'overthinking' or being 'lazy.' This is about a system that failed to protect an employee who was giving too much.

If you feel that nagging anxiety or overwhelming exhaustion, listen to it. Don’t wait for the ultimate breaking point. Your life is not a fair price for quarterly profits or project deadlines. Waiting is self-inflicted torture — and in my case, it was nearly fatal. Seek specialised help immediately.
