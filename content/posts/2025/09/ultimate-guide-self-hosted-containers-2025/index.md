In 2025, the world of self-hosting with containers has expanded into a vast and exciting ecosystem. This guide provides a categorized list of some of the best containerized applications available, helping you build, manage, and enhance your home lab or production environment.

While many of the examples and community resources you'll find are based on Docker, the applications themselves are platform-agnostic. You can run them on various container runtimes like Podman, LXC, or within orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. The core idea is the same: packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated, portable units.
