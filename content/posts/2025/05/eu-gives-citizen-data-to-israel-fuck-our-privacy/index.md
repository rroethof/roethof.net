## Introduction: So Much for Sovereignty, The EU Just Pissed on Our Rights (And Our Wallets)

Hold the fucking presses. Forget any lingering bullshit about 'digital sovereignty' or pathetic national attempts to control *anything*. According to Metro Nieuws, the **fucking European Commission just granted Israel access to the data of ALL EU citizens.** [Link to Metro Nieuws article](https://www.metronieuws.nl/in-het-nieuws/buitenland/2025/05/israel-europese-commissie-burgers-data/)

Yes, you read that right. **ALL EU CITIZENS.** That includes the Dutch. That includes **You** and **ME**.

Let me be absolutely crystal clear: **What in the deepest pits of bureaucratic hell gives these unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats in Brussels the fucking right to make decisions about *MY* personal data?** It's just one more way they show utter contempt for the people they supposedly serve, alongside policies that feel designed to bleed us dry.

## I Didn't Vote For This Shit. In Fact, We Voted AGAINST It.

Who the fuck are these people? I didn't vote for Ursula von der Leyen or her Commission cronies. I have absolutely zero democratic say over their actions. More importantly, let's rewind to **June 1, 2005**. Remember that? The Netherlands held a referendum on the EU Constitution – the very blueprint for this kind of federalist overreach. And what happened? **A resounding 61.5% of Dutch voters said "NEE!"**. We explicitly rejected giving more power, more sovereignty, to this Brussels machine.

And yet, here we are. Less than two decades later, that same machine, acting with zero mandate from *us*, unilaterally decides to hand over the keys to our digital lives – likely via databases like EURODAC – to a non-EU state. This isn't just negligence; it's a deliberate fucking betrayal of the democratic will expressed by the Dutch people. It's spitting in your face and on our vote.

## GDPR? European Values? Don't Make Me Fucking Laugh. The Audacity is Breathtaking.

Remember all that noise about GDPR? The "gold standard" of data protection? What a fucking joke that looks like now. How does unilaterally granting a foreign state access to potentially sensitive biometric and personal data of 450 million people square with *any* principle of data minimization, purpose limitation, or consent? It doesn't.

And the hypocrisy is fucking breathtaking. Just as this news breaks about them *giving* our data to Israel, reports surface that they've slammed TikTok with a **€530 MILLION GDPR fine** for sending EU data to *China*! [Link to Hacker News article on TikTok fine](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/tiktok-slammed-with-530-million-gdpr.html)

So let me get this straight:
*   **Private Company (TikTok) sends EU data to China:** MASSIVE €530 Million fine! GDPR violation! Outrage! Protect the citizens!
*   **EU Commission ITSELF gives EU data to Israel:** Crickets? Approved? Just business as usual?

It's not about principles; it's about politics and power. GDPR isn't a shield for citizens; it's a fucking weapon they wield selectively against targets they don't like, while completely ignoring it when it suits their own geopolitical agenda. They preach "European values" while acting like authoritarian data brokers with blatant double standards. They talk about protecting us from Big Tech surveillance while orchestrating state-level data transfers that would make Mark Zuckerberg blush, *and* punishing others for doing functionally the same thing they just did! It's the same pattern: rules and hardship for us, impunity and benefits for them and their chosen partners.

## The Only Real Answer: NEXIT. Fuck This Power Grab and Economic Strangulation.

Forget tinkering around the edges with decentralization or FOSS. That's like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. This latest betrayal – handing *our* data to Israel without a shred of democratic mandate, while simultaneously fining others for similar data transfers – proves the entire EU project is fundamentally broken, hypocritical, and rotten to the core.

You think decentralization fixes *this*? Bullshit. The problem isn't just *how* they store the data; it's the fact that these unelected fuckers think they have the *right* to make these decisions for us in the first place, applying rules to others that they themselves ignore.

And it's not just about data, is it? It feels like **Von der Leyen and her  minions are actively trying to rob us blind.** Policies that drive up costs, regulations that strangle people and small businesses, energy prices through the fucking roof – it feels like a deliberate effort to **fuck us over raw**, making life harder and harder, maybe so we can't even afford basic necessities like fucking Vaseline, let alone fight back. They treat our privacy like a commodity to be traded, and our economic well-being like collateral damage in their power games. **Goddamn bastards.**

The *only* correct answer is **NEXIT**. Get the fuck out.

Maybe the old EEC, focused purely on economic cooperation, worked fine. It had a purpose. But this? This bloated, power-hungry monstrosity in Brussels? It's run by bullshit bastards who only care about accumulating more control, more power, trampling over national sovereignty and democratic votes (remember 2005?) whenever it suits them. They don't give a damn about our basic right to privacy, except when they can use it as a stick to beat someone else with. They don't give a damn about whether we can afford to heat our homes or feed our families. They see us, our data, our lives, our money, as resources to be managed, exploited, and traded for their political games.

This data-sharing deal isn't an isolated incident; it's a symptom of a disease. The disease is unchecked federalism, hypocrisy, economic mismanagement bordering on malice, and contempt for the citizens they supposedly serve. The cure isn't trying to fix the unfixable from within. The cure is amputation. Cut ties. **NEXIT**. Reclaim actual sovereignty, not the bullshit illusion they keep trying to sell us while they give away the fucking store, fine others for leaving the back door unlocked, and seemingly try to bleed us dry in the process.

## Conclusion: An Act of Treason, Rank Hypocrisy, and Economic Assault Against EU Citizens

This isn't just another bureaucratic blunder. Giving away the personal data of nearly half a billion people without their consent, especially against the explicitly stated will of populations like the Dutch, is an act of profound betrayal. It's a middle finger to democracy, privacy, and national sovereignty.

Doing this while simultaneously levying enormous fines against a company like TikTok for sending data *out* of the EU exposes the rank hypocrisy at the heart of the Commission. The rules are for thee, not for EU.

And layered on top of this is the pervasive feeling that the EU leadership, personified by figures like Von der Leyen, views its own citizens with disdain, imposing policies that create hardship while they operate with impunity. They didn't ask about the data. They don't care what we think about their economic policies. They hold us in contempt.

So, the question isn't *if* they'll fuck us over again, but *how* – whether it's our data, our democracy, or our ability to make ends meet. And more importantly: **What the fuck are we, the people whose data they just traded away while preaching privacy to others and seemingly squeezing us economically, going to do about it?** Don't just get angry. Stay angry. Demand answers. Demand accountability. Because they sure as hell aren't going to offer it willingly.

P.S. If you think I'm mad ranting about the EU. hell yes I am.. they dont give a fucking shit about you or me, we can starve for all they care, as long as those bastards get the power and money.
