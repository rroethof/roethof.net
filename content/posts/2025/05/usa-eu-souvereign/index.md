Sorry to bash this *again*, but politics and big tech just keep going downhill. This week’s news: Microsoft promises to sue the US government if it blocks access to their cloud services in Europe. They’re also storing code backups in Switzerland, so European partners can access them in emergencies.

**Summary:**  
Microsoft made five promises to European governments to guarantee continued access to their cloud services. They say they’ll go to court if the US tries to block their services in the EU (though they claim that’s unlikely). There’s now a European board overseeing their datacenter operations, and code backups are being stored securely in Switzerland. European partners will have the right to use that code if things go south. Microsoft also wants to expand its European datacenter capacity by 40% in the next two years and promises to comply with European laws.

**My opinion:**  
It all sounds noble, but the core problem remains: Europe is still far too dependent on American tech giants for its digital infrastructure. Microsoft promising to sue the US if things go wrong is mostly a sign that they know how fragile this dependency really is. And honestly, if it ever comes to a real geopolitical conflict, do you really think a lawsuit against the US government will make a difference?

It’s good that there’s more attention on digital sovereignty, but let’s be honest: the EU is just as much a part of the problem as the US. Brussels loves to talk about “strategic autonomy,” but in practice, the EU is slow, bureaucratic, and far too cozy with big tech lobbyists. We don’t need more empty EU frameworks or another round of “Digital Sovereignty” whitepapers. We need real, national sovereignty—countries taking back control over their own digital infrastructure, making their own choices, and not waiting for the next EU compromise that waters everything down.

As long as we keep relying on companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, and as long as we keep waiting for the EU to save us, we’re just mopping the floor while the tap is still running. The call for national cloud services is justified and should have been a priority years ago. Hopefully, these developments will finally push countries to take digital independence seriously—on their own terms.

Until then, I’ll keep writing these kinds of posts. As long as politics and tech are so intertwined, and Europe keeps lagging behind, things will keep going wrong.


### The Cloud Act and the Ethics of Digital Dependency

Let’s dig a little deeper. The US Cloud Act doesn’t just apply to American soil—it reaches into Europe too. Even if European law like the GDPR conflicts with the Cloud Act, European employees of Microsoft (or any US company) can’t simply ignore orders from their US parent company. In practice, it’s a choice between breaking European law or risking your career. And even if Microsoft stores data in a 100% European datacenter, as long as the parent company is American, the Cloud Act still applies. This is exactly what the Schrems II ruling criticized.

Is this even ethical? Employees are stuck between conflicting legal systems—forced to choose between following European privacy law or obeying their employer’s (and the US government’s) demands. That’s not just a legal dilemma, but a deeply ethical one. Some readers rightly point out that individual employees in Europe are protected by EU labor law and can’t simply be fired for following the law. True, but the real complexity is at the organizational level. The Cloud Act obliges American companies (and their wholly owned subsidiaries) to provide data, even if it’s stored in Europe. The lack of public examples of actual European cloud data being handed over is partly due to gag orders: companies that comply with such requests are not allowed to disclose them. That doesn’t make the risk purely theoretical—it just makes it invisible.

Microsoft’s efforts to improve this situation are valuable, but as long as the infrastructure remains under US control, the risk—however small—remains real.

### Strategic Autonomy ≠ Protectionism

Let’s be clear: “strategic independence” isn’t just a reaction to Trump or any single US president. American policy has always been about advancing US interests—trade, sanctions, extraterritorial laws, you name it. The real question is: why do we want independence? Digital infrastructure is now as essential as energy or defense. That means countries need real self-determination, not just empty talk or protectionism from Brussels.

So yes, beware of fearmongering and knee-jerk protectionism. But don’t underestimate the importance of true strategic autonomy—at the national level. We’ve learned this lesson too late, too often—think Privacy Shield, PRISM, the Cloud Act, Huawei/5G, or even our gas dependency while we sit on reserves in Groningen and the North Sea.

### And now for the fireworks

Let’s not sugarcoat it: the EU is a huge part of the problem. Brussels is slow, bureaucratic, and far too cozy with big tech lobbyists. Every so-called “strategic autonomy” initiative ends up as another watered-down compromise, more paperwork, and zero real sovereignty. The EU loves to talk, but when it comes to actually protecting European interests, it folds—every single time.

If we want real digital independence, we need to stop waiting for the EU to save us. The only way forward is national sovereignty: countries taking back control over their own digital infrastructure, making their own choices, and not waiting for the next EU committee to decide what’s “allowed.” The EU has proven, time and again, that it’s incapable of standing up to US pressure or big tech influence.

So yes—fuck the EU. If you care about digital sovereignty, look to your own country, not Brussels. Only national action will break the cycle of dependence and compromise. Until then, expect more of the same: empty promises, endless delays, and a digital future that’s anything but sovereign.
