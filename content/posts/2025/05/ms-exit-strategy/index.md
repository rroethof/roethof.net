## Introduction: Bend Over and Say Thank You (The Microsoft Way)

Let’s be blunt: most companies are completely **vendor-locked** into Microsoft (or VMware, or pick your poison). And when Microsoft decides to jack up prices by 300% or change the rules overnight, what do most organizations do? They bend over, say thank you, and pay up. No exit strategy, no alternatives, just blind faith in the cloud gospel.

Sound familiar? It should. Because this is the reality for almost every business and institution I see. And it’s not just about money—it’s about control, sovereignty, and the ability to say “no” when a vendor starts acting like a monopolist.

## Why Is There Never an Exit Plan?

Lesson 101 in IT: **Always have an exit strategy.** Yet somehow, when it comes to Microsoft (or VMware, or insert your favorite SaaS overlord), that lesson goes out the window. Everyone migrates to M365E3 or some other “cloud solution” without a clear business case, and—more importantly—without a backup plan for when the vendor inevitably screws them over.

Why? Because it’s easy. Because it’s “modern.” Because nobody wants to be the one who says, “Hey, maybe we shouldn’t put all our eggs in one basket.” And because, frankly, if it’s not your own money on the line, why bother fighting the tide?

## The Cloud Trap: Sexy, Expensive, and Addictive

Let’s talk about the cloud. Sure, it’s sexy. Sure, it’s “innovative.” But it’s also a trap. Once you’re in, you’re in. Price hikes? Feature removals? Arbitrary policy changes? Tough luck. You’re locked in, and getting out is a nightmare.

And don’t get me started on the “fair pricing” myth. In the software world, fair pricing is a joke. 300% price increases are now the norm, not the exception. And most customers have no choice but to swallow it.

## There *Are* Alternatives (But You Have to Care)

Here’s the thing: **there are alternatives**. You don’t have to go all-in on the cloud. You don’t have to rent your software forever. You can still buy perpetual licenses. You can still run on-premises solutions. It might not be as “cool” as the latest SaaS buzzword, but it works—and it puts you back in control.

But that requires effort. It requires caring about where your money goes. It requires pushing back against revenue-driven sales machines and thinking for yourself. Most importantly, it requires a willingness to say, “No, we’re not going to let a vendor dictate our entire IT strategy.”

## Why You Need an Exit Strategy (Now, Not Later)

If you don’t have an exit strategy, you’re at the mercy of whatever Microsoft (or any other vendor) decides to do next. And trust me, they will do something next. Price hikes, forced migrations, feature removals, you name it. If you’re not ready to steer away, you’re going to get screwed. It’s not a matter of if, but when.

**Don’t wait until you’re trapped. Build your exit plan now.** Look at alternatives. Keep your options open. And remember: the only thing worse than being vendor-locked is realizing it too late.
