In a [previous post](/posts/2025/03/my-quest-for-ergonomic-bliss-a-journey-to-find-a-split-keyboard-that-works-with-tietses-syndrome/), I shared my journey to find an ergonomic split keyboard to help manage the chronic pain of Tietze's syndrome. Following that, I discussed my needs with my employer and requested support in acquiring a more suitable keyboard. They responded by asking me to delve deeper into the available options, specifically looking at the ergonomic benefits these keyboards offer and providing a clear overview of their costs. This also prompted me to consider the location of the manufacturers due to current geopolitical factors and potential implications for pricing and tariffs.

## The Initial Price Shock and Research Scope

As I embarked on this research, one of the first things that became apparent was the price point. Some of the models that boasted impressive ergonomic features came with a significant cost, prompting me to explore a wider range of possibilities to find a balance between effectiveness and affordability.

## Exploring Premium Split Keyboard Options and Manufacturing Location

Among the premium options that caught my eye were the [Dygma Defy](https://dygma.com/products/dygma-defy) and the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager). The Dygma Defy, manufactured by a Spanish company, offers a modular design and options for wireless connectivity and tenting, presenting a highly customizable solution, albeit at a higher end of the price spectrum (around $539 USD including shipping and import for my chosen configuration). The ZSA Voyager, a product of a USA-based company shipping from Taiwan, is known for its portability and split ergonomic design and was another strong contender at a slightly lower price point ($365 USD including shipping, but excluding potential import duties). The USA origin is a point to consider regarding potential future tariffs and shipping complexities.

## Discovering Budget-Friendly and Local Alternatives

Realizing the initial costs might be a hurdle, I began searching for more budget-friendly alternatives and even looked into local suppliers here in the Netherlands. That's when I stumbled upon [splitkb.com/](https://splitkb.com/), based in Hardenberg. They offer a fascinating range of split keyboards, including the [Iris CE](https://keeb.io/products/iris-ce-keyboard?variant=40391622262878)) and the [Sofle Choc Pro](https://www.keebart.com/products/sofle)). Supporting a Dutch supplier like splitkb.com is appealing, although their focus is primarily on kits.

## The DIY World of Keyboard Kits and Ergonomic Benefits

What was particularly interesting about splitkb.com was the availability of kits. For instance, while the Iris CE (designed by the community) is available pre-built from various sources (including a USA-based one in this listing, around $339.93 USD including shipping, excluding import), many of their offerings and some from other enthusiasts, come as kits that require self-assembly and soldering. The ergonomic benefits of these split designs, however, remain significant, offering the potential for natural arm and wrist positioning. While fantastic for customization, the DIY nature likely wouldn't be the most practical solution for a workplace setup requiring immediate use.

## A Mid-Range Contender: The Sofle Choc Pro (EU Manufacturing)

The Sofle Choc Pro, available from a German supplier ([https://www.keebart.com/products/sofle](https://www.keebart.com/products/sofle)), presented another intriguing option at a mid-range price (€316.64 EUR including shipping and import for my chosen configuration). Being manufactured and shipped within the EU is a definite advantage in terms of potential tariffs and shipping times. This keyboard also boasts significant ergonomic benefits through its split design and optional tenting.

## The Overwhelming World of Ergonomic Keyboards and Benefit Analysis

What struck me most during this research process was the sheer vastness of the ergonomic keyboard world. From different split designs and key layouts (like ortholinear vs. columnar staggered) to a dizzying array of mechanical switches and keycaps, it's easy to get completely lost in the details. However, the core ergonomic benefits of these split keyboards consistently revolve around:

* **Natural Arm and Shoulder Positioning:** The split design allows for a more relaxed and neutral posture, reducing strain on the shoulders, neck and upper back – crucial for managing Tietze's syndrome.
* **Wrist Comfort:** Many offer adjustable tilt and tenting options to keep wrists in a neutral position, minimizing the risk of strain and discomfort.
* **Reduced Finger Travel:** Ortholinear or columnar staggered layouts can minimize awkward finger movements, potentially reducing hand fatigue.
* **Customization:** Programmable keys and layers allow for a personalized workflow, reducing the need for excessive reaching.

## Considering Practicalities, Costs and Manufacturing Location for Workplace Use

As I explored these various options, I kept in mind the practicalities of potentially implementing one of these solutions in my workplace. Factors like ease of setup, compatibility, cost (including potential import duties based on the manufacturer's location) and the need for a pre-built solution are all important considerations. My preference leans towards EU or locally manufactured options if the quality and ergonomic benefits meet my needs, to mitigate potential pricing fluctuations and shipping complexities associated with USA-based manufacturers.

### Awaiting the Next Step in My Ergonomic Journey

Having completed this research into the ergonomic benefits and costs of various split keyboards, while also considering their manufacturing locations, I have now provided this information to my employer. Given the significant investment these specialized keyboards represent – a cost that isn't easily absorbed personally – I am hopeful for a positive response that will enable me to work more comfortably and productively while better managing my Tietze's syndrome. I eagerly await their decision and the next step in this journey towards finding a more ergonomic workspace.
