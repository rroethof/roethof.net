## Introduction: Seeking Ergonomic Support at Work

In a [previous post](/posts/2025/03/my-quest-for-ergonomic-bliss-a-journey-to-find-a-split-keyboard-that-works-with-tietses-syndrome/), I detailed my personal search for an ergonomic split keyboard to alleviate the chronic pain associated with Tietze's syndrome. Following this, I approached my employer to discuss the possibility of acquiring a more suitable keyboard for my workstation. They responded constructively, requesting a more in-depth exploration of available options, focusing on their ergonomic benefits and associated costs. This also necessitated considering the manufacturers' locations due to current geopolitical factors and their potential impact on pricing and tariffs.

## Initial Findings: A Wide Range of Prices

My initial foray into the world of ergonomic split keyboards quickly revealed a significant disparity in price points. While some models boasted impressive ergonomic features and cutting-edge designs, their substantial cost prompted me to broaden my research to identify more affordable yet effective alternatives.

## Exploring Premium Options and Manufacturing Origins

Among the higher-end contenders were the [Dygma Defy](https://dygma.com/products/dygma-defy) and the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager). The Dygma Defy, manufactured by a Spanish company, stands out with its modular design and options for wireless connectivity and tenting, offering a highly customizable experience at a premium (around $539 USD including shipping and import for my chosen configuration). The [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager), produced by a USA-based company and shipped from Taiwan, presents a sleek and portable split ergonomic design at a slightly lower price ($365 USD including shipping, excluding potential import duties). The USA origin of the Voyager is a factor to consider regarding potential future tariffs and shipping complexities.

## Discovering More Accessible Alternatives and a Local Vendor

To explore more budget-friendly options and support local businesses, I investigated vendors within the Netherlands. This led me to [splitkb.com/](https://splitkb.com/), based in Hardenberg. This Dutch company offers a wide array of split keyboard parts and kits, catering to the DIY community. While splitkb.com is a valuable resource for components and building projects, they do not typically sell fully assembled keyboards like the Iris CE.

## The DIY Route: Keyboard Kits and Their Practicality

Splitkb.com's extensive selection of parts and kits includes designs like the popular Iris CE. The Iris CE, a community-designed keyboard known for its ergonomic layout, generally requires self-assembly when sourced through vendors like splitkb.com. Pre-built versions of the Iris CE are available from other sources, such as [Keebio, a USA-based company](https://keeb.io/products/iris-ce-keyboard?variant=40391622262878). While DIY kits offer significant customization potential and ergonomic benefits, they are likely not the most practical solution for a workplace requiring an immediately usable, employer-purchased keyboard.

## A Mid-Range EU Option: The Sofle Choc Pro

The [Sofle Choc Pro](https://www.keebart.com/products/sofle), offered by a German supplier at a mid-range price (€316.64 EUR including shipping and import for my chosen configuration), presents an intriguing alternative. Its EU origin for both manufacturing and shipping is advantageous in terms of potential tariffs and shipping times. This keyboard also offers notable ergonomic benefits through its split design and optional tenting. However, its smaller thumb cluster, with limited readily accessible modifier keys, might not be optimal for my workflow.

## Understanding the Ergonomic Advantages of Split Keyboards

My research highlighted the consistent ergonomic benefits offered by split keyboards:

* **Natural Arm and Shoulder Positioning:** The split design promotes a more relaxed and neutral posture, significantly reducing strain on the shoulders, neck, and upper back – a crucial factor for managing Tietze's syndrome.
* **Wrist Comfort:** Many models offer adjustable tilt and tenting capabilities, allowing for neutral wrist positioning and minimizing the risk of strain and discomfort.
* **Reduced Finger Travel:** Ortholinear or columnar staggered layouts can minimize awkward finger movements, potentially alleviating hand fatigue.
* **Customization:** Programmable keys and layers enable a personalized workflow, reducing the need for excessive reaching and promoting efficiency.

## Workplace Considerations: Practicality, Cost, and Location

In evaluating these options for workplace implementation, practicality, cost (including potential import duties based on the manufacturer's location), and the availability of pre-built units are key considerations. While I appreciate the local aspect of splitkb.com, their focus on kits makes them less suitable for a direct employer purchase. My preference leans towards pre-built options from manufacturers within the EU or locally, if they meet the necessary quality and ergonomic standards, to mitigate potential pricing fluctuations and shipping complexities associated with USA-based manufacturers.

## Preferred Options: ZSA Voyager and Keebio Iris CE

Among the researched keyboards, the **ZSA Voyager** and the **Keebio Iris CE** stand out as my preferred options. The Voyager strikes a compelling balance between a modern aesthetic and functional ergonomics. The Iris CE is also a beautifully designed board with a well-regarded ergonomic layout and a more substantial thumb cluster that appeals to my anticipated needs for modifier key access.

### Awaiting the Company's Response

Having completed this research into the ergonomic benefits and costs of various split keyboards, while also considering their manufacturing locations, I have now provided this information to my employer. Given the significant investment these specialized keyboards represent – a cost that isn't easily absorbed personally – I am hopeful for a positive response that will enable me to work more comfortably and productively while better managing my Tietze's syndrome. I eagerly await the company's decision on how we can best move forward.
