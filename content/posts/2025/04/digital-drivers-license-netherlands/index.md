Let's be blunt: the Dutch government wants your driver's license on your phone. Sounds convenient, right? Think again. I've spent years knee-deep in security and privacy, building and securing systems from the ground up ([see my bare metal vs. cloud post](posts/2025/04/bare-metal-vs-cloud-my-perspective/)). This digital driver's license screams "disaster waiting to happen." My experience building the infrastructure for the [COVID-19 QR code system for the RIVM](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-certificate/proof-of-vaccination) ([read more about the burnout that project caused](posts/2025/03/the-sleep-deprived-sysadmin-how-lack-of-sleep-affects-performance-productivity-and-security/)) has given me a unique perspective on the potential pitfalls of large-scale digital identity projects.

The official line is all about convenience and control. Bullshit. This is about *them* gaining more control over *your* data. They'll claim it's just your driver's license, but that's a lie. This is the thin end of the wedge. Next, it'll be your climate score, carbon footprint, health data—your entire digital life, neatly packaged and accessible to whoever wants it.

How often do you even *use* your driver's license? Once a year, maybe? Mine's probably gathering dust. This isn't about making things easier; it's about making things *trackable*.

### The Tech Behind the "Convenience": A Closer Look

They'll likely use blockchain, claiming it's unhackable. Please. Blockchain is only as secure as its implementation, and governments have a terrible track record with security. Then there's encryption—what kind? How are the keys managed? Biometrics—fingerprints, facial recognition—are also likely. That's sensitive data ripe for misuse. And the integration with other government systems? A data breach waiting to happen. My experience in penetration testing and security ([see my post on excessive security measures](posts/2025/03/the-paradox-of-excessive-security-measures-when-does-safers-become-overkill/)) makes me deeply skeptical. The potential for vulnerabilities is immense, especially considering the complexity of integrating this system with existing government databases.

### Privacy and Control: The Big, Fat Question Marks

The government talks about "convenience" and "control." Who's kidding who? Who controls *their* access to your data? Who guarantees its safety against cyberattacks and government misuse? What happens if the system is hacked? The Belastingdienst/Toeslagen scandal ([link to news article about the scandal](https://nos.nl/artikel/2428776-toeslagenaffaire-een-chronologie)) is a stark warning. Numerous data breaches highlight the urgent need to prioritize data security. We need action, not empty promises. My experience with the COVID-19 QR code system reinforced this—the pressure to deliver quickly often overshadows crucial security considerations.

Then there's the practical side. A friend got pulled over for speeding, no license. Warning. The cop told him about a guy fished out of a ditch after an accident, unconscious for a week before they could ID him. A physical license would have made all the difference. This isn't just about privacy; it's about basic functionality.

The RDW has been working on this for ten years. Ten years! They've been planning this digital takeover for a decade. (Conspiracy theorists, I'm not saying anything, but…)

We're handing over our privacy, our freedom, bit by bit. And because it's "modern" and "convenient," we're all too happy to comply. Don't say you weren't warned.

This isn't about convenience; it's about control. And they're not giving it to you.


**Don't Be a Sheep. Think for Yourself.**
