Following up on my previous posts about the ongoing quest for ergonomic bliss, I'm thrilled to share that the ZSA Voyager has finally arrived and is now part of my daily setup! This marks a significant milestone in managing the challenges posed by Tietze's Syndrome during my work. If you missed the first part of this journey, you can read about it here:

### The Journey Begins

The journey to acquiring this specific ergonomic keyboard was, to put it mildly, a marathon rather than a sprint. It involved a considerable amount of persistence and navigating through a lengthy administrative process. From the initial request to the final order, the entire process spanned **several months**, requiring consistent follow-ups and, eventually, the involvement of internal advocacy channels to ensure the necessary support was provided. While the specifics of the internal process are not for public consumption, suffice it to say that securing essential ergonomic tools can sometimes be a test of patience and determination.

### A Crucial Consequence of the Delay

It's important to acknowledge that the extended duration of the acquisition process unfortunately meant that my chest issues, stemming from Tietze's Syndrome, progressed to a chronic state. My initial request for this ergonomic solution was precisely to prevent such an escalation. This outcome, which I had desperately hoped to avoid with a timely intervention, now means I contend with 24/7 chest pains. This profoundly underscores the critical need for responsive and efficient support systems when dealing with health-related workplace accommodations.

But let's shift focus to the star of the show: the ZSA Voyager.

### Initial Impressions: A Leap into the Ergonomic Unknown

Upon unboxing, the Voyager immediately impresses with its build quality and modular design. The ability to adjust the tenting and splay, and the overall compact footprint, felt promising. As someone accustomed to traditional keyboards, the split layout and ortholinear key arrangement were a significant departure.

The first few days were, predictably, a steep learning curve. My muscle memory for typing was completely rewired. I found myself constantly looking down at the keys, and my typing speed plummeted. The default key layout, while logical, required mental recalibration. Interestingly, after just two days of use, I received a friendly follow-up from ZSA. My direct feedback to them summarized the experience perfectly:

> It arrived friday exactly when the company closed, just in time ðŸ™‚ I am training on it at this moment, its a learning curve hahahaha. It does feel better for my shoulders and chest already, very motivating :)"
> 
> Ronny

This immediate positive ergonomic feedback, despite the initial typing adjustment, was incredibly motivating. The configurator (Oryx) is incredibly powerful, allowing for deep customization. I spent a good amount of time tweaking key placements, adding layers for symbols and navigation, and setting up tap-dance and hold functions to minimize finger travel. This customization phase is crucial for any split ergonomic keyboard, and the Voyager's software makes it relatively painless.

### A Few Weeks In: Embracing the New Normal

After a few weeks of consistent use, the transformation has been remarkable. My typing speed has gradually returned to acceptable levels, and more importantly, the **discomfort in my chest, neck, and shoulders has noticeably decreased.** The split design allows my shoulders to relax, and the tenting keeps my wrists in a much more natural, neutral position.

To provide a more detailed update, here's a recent message I shared with Mike from ZSA regarding my progress:

> Hey Mike,
> 
> Quick update from me on the Voyager ðŸ™‚
> I have been using the voyager daily since week one, and yes in the first week i had to revert to the keyboard laptop sometimes during work obviously, 
> but i kept challenging myself to use the voyager full time and steadily its growing on me.
> 
> I am still not completely using ten vingers, but i can now type on a decent speed on it and it helps a LOT with my posture and chestpains from the Tietze;s syndrome.
> I am loving it, tinkering with the settings, fiddling with the rgb etc.. i must say i often have the space/backspace mixed up tho lol"
> 
> Ronny

This feedback truly highlights the progress. While I'm still not fully touch-typing with all ten fingers, I've reached a decent speed, and the positive impact on my posture and the reduction in Tietze's related chest pains are significant.

In fact, my feeling today is that I am now fully accustomed to the keyboard. The ortholinear layout, initially jarring, now feels incredibly intuitive. The keys are directly beneath where my fingers naturally fall, reducing lateral finger movement. I've found myself utilizing the thumb clusters far more than I anticipated, assigning frequently used modifiers and layer switches to them, which further reduces strain on my pinky fingers. It's reached a point where traditional, staggered keyboards now feel genuinely weird to use. I truly love the Voyager.

The portability of the Voyager is also a huge plus. Its ability to fold up neatly makes it easy to transport between different workspaces, which is a practical benefit that was a key factor in its selection.

**Pros after a few weeks:**
* **Significant ergonomic improvement:** Reduced pain and strain in wrists, shoulders, and chest.
* **Deep customization:** Oryx configurator is a game-changer for personalizing the layout.
* **Build quality:** Feels robust and well-engineered.
* **Portability:** Easy to carry around.
* **Improved posture:** Naturally encourages a more open and relaxed typing posture.
* **Full adaptation:** Traditional keyboards now feel unnatural, highlighting the success of the transition.

**Cons after a few weeks:**
* **Steep initial learning curve:** Expect a few days to a week of slow, deliberate typing.
* **Cost:** It's a significant investment, though well worth it for health benefits.
* **Dependency on customization:** To truly shine, it requires dedicated time to configure to your specific needs.
* **Minor layout quirks:** Occasional mix-ups (like space/backspace) require ongoing adjustment.

### Conclusion

The ZSA Voyager is not just a keyboard; it's an investment in long-term health and productivity, especially for those dealing with conditions like Tietze's Syndrome. While the path to acquiring it was longer and more involved than anticipated, the ergonomic benefits I've experienced in just a few weeks have already made it incredibly worthwhile.

This is just the beginning of my journey with the Voyager. I plan to continue refining my keymap and exploring its full potential. Stay tuned for more updates as I delve deeper into its capabilities and how it further impacts my daily work life.
