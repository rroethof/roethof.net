My recent heart attack in September 2024 was a wake-up call, forcing me to re-evaluate my priorities and make significant changes to my daily life. While I'm grateful to have survived, the aftermath has been a journey of self-discovery and adaptation. 

One unexpected challenge I've faced is managing the chronic pain associated with Tietze's syndrome, a condition that affects the joints of my shoulder blade and collarbone. As I navigate this new reality, I've discovered the importance of finding comfort and relief at my desk â€“ and that's where ergonomic split keyboards come in.

## Understanding Tietze's Syndrome
For those who may not be familiar, Tietze's syndrome is characterized by inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding the joints of the scapula (shoulder blade) and clavicle (collarbone). This can lead to pain, stiffness and limited mobility in the chest, neck, shoulders and arms.

## The Origins of My Journey
As someone who's struggling with the chronic pain and stiffness associated with Tietze's syndrome, I knew I needed a solution that would allow me to work comfortably for hours on end without exacerbating my symptoms. 

This led me to explore the world of ergonomic split keyboards.

## What are Split Keyboards?
Split keyboards, also known as ergonomic keyboards or split mechanical keyboards, are designed to reduce strain on the body by allowing the user to position their arms and hands in a more neutral position. The split design typically involves dividing the keyboard into two halves, with each half containing its own set of keys. I was intrigued by this concept and decided to learn more.

### Benefits for Tietze's Syndrome
For individuals with Tietze's syndrome, split keyboards can be particularly beneficial. By reducing strain on the joints and allowing for more natural movement, these keyboards can help alleviate pain and discomfort. 

I am eager to experience this relief firsthand.

## My Research and Recommendations
I have compiled a list of top-rated split keyboards that I believe could be suitable for my needs. After conducting thorough research, I am confident that one of these keyboards could be the perfect solution for me. Specifically, I am requesting consideration for a ZSA Voyager from my employer, citing the benefits not only for my health but also for the company's 
productivity and employee well-being.

### My Initial Affection for the ZSA Moonlander and Glove 80
I was initially smitten with the ZSA Moonlander and the Glove 80. The Glove 80's unique design and ergonomic features truly caught my eye and I appreciated its focus on comfort and style. However, as I delved deeper into research, I began to consider a few factors that would impact my decision.

### Why I Chose the ZSA Voyager
While the Glove 80 is a beautiful and well-designed keyboard, its large size and plastic construction didn't quite fit with my personal preferences. I was looking for a more compact option that would be easier to take on the go, while still providing excellent ergonomic benefits. 

The ZSA Voyager's split design and portable footprint make it an ideal choice for someone like me who needs flexibility in their workspace. With its portability and ergonomic features, the ZSA Voyager seems like an ideal solution for someone like me who needs to balance productivity with mobility and comfort. 

I'm excited to see how this keyboard will help me manage my Tietze's syndrome and improve my overall well-being and hope to share my experiences with others who may be struggling with similar challenges. By understanding the importance of ergonomics in our daily lives, we can take steps towards a healthier, more comfortable future.
