Hello tech community! The days are getting longer, the air is getting warmer, and I'm feeling energized by the possibilities of the year ahead in my ongoing adventure with technology. To kick things off with a fresh perspective this spring, I wanted to share the tech tools that have become my favorites in the first part of 2025, helping me manage my systems, enhance security, and automate the tasks that would otherwise drive me nuts – all with renewed vigor.

## Hardware Highlights

### My Trusty Daily Driver: The Dell XPS 9530

My current daily driver is the **Dell XPS 9530**. Powering it all is **Arch Linux** with the dynamic tiling window manager **Hyprland**. This combination provides a highly customizable and efficient environment for my tasks, which often include running virtual machines and software development.

Under the hood, this machine packs a punch with a **Intel Core i9-12900HK processor** (featuring 14 cores for excellent multitasking) and **32 GB DDR5 memory**. For graphics-intensive tasks and the occasional gaming session, it's equipped with an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU**.

The visual experience is fantastic thanks to the **15.6-inch OLED InfinityEdge display** with a crisp resolution of **3456 x 2160**. The touch functionality and vibrant colors (100% DCI-P3 color gamut) make it a joy to work on. Storage is handled by **two 1TB M.2 NVMe SSDs**, providing ample space and lightning-fast data access. When I'm working from my home or office, this setup expands into a highly productive triple-display configuration, which is incredibly beneficial for managing multiple applications and workflows simultaneously.

### My Mobile Workhorse: The Microsoft Surface Pro 6
For on-the-go tasks and situations where portability is key, I rely on my **Microsoft Surface Pro 6**. Its compact form factor and versatility as both a tablet and a laptop make it ideal for quick mobility, taking notes with the stylus during meetings, efficiently signing documents, and handling quick meetings where a full laptop might be cumbersome. While it might not have the raw power of my XPS, it strikes a great balance between size and functionality for mobile productivity in these scenarios.

### My Ubiquitous Companion: Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G

My smartphone is the **Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G**, a more budget-friendly (sub 250 euro) option that still packs some excellent specs, especially when it comes to the camera. The 200MP main camera is truly impressive, allowing me to capture detailed photos for documenting configurations, taking quick snapshots, and even for some impromptu macro shots. The phone also offers a smooth user experience and reliable performance for staying connected and accessing essential apps.

## Software Standouts

### My Daily Driver OS: Arch Linux with hyprland

As mentioned with my Dell XPS, **Arch Linux** is my operating system of choice for my laptop. Its rolling-release nature ensures I always have access to the latest software, and the high level of customization allows me to tailor the system precisely to my needs and preferences.

### My Server OS: Debian

When it comes to my servers, I like things stable and secure, which is why I run Debian 12. Let's be honest, it's often called the daddy of Linux for a reason! This fantastic Linux-based OS is all about Free Software – meaning it's completely free to use, modify, and share. The Debian project is super dedicated to this, which I really appreciate. Plus, it's known for being rock-solid and getting regular security updates, so I can trust it to keep my server stuff running smoothly.

### The Automation Powerhouse: Ansible

It should come as no surprise that Ansible continues to be my automation powerhouse of choice. Whether I'm managing my home lab, setting up new virtual machines, or ensuring consistent configurations across systems, Ansible's agentless architecture and declarative language make it incredibly efficient and easy to use. 

### The Terminal Workhorse: Zsh with Oh My Zsh

Life in IT wouldn't be the same without a powerful and customizable terminal. My current setup revolves around **Zsh**, enhanced with **Oh My Zsh** and a carefully curated set of plugins. The improved tab completion, helpful aliases, and informative prompts significantly boost my productivity when navigating the command line – which, let's be honest, is where I spend a good chunk of my day.

### The Essential Editor: Visual Studio Code

For all things text-based, from writing code and Ansible playbooks to crafting these blog posts, **Visual Studio Code** is my essential editor. Its extensive ecosystem of extensions provides fantastic support for various languages and tools. Features like integrated Git, the built-in terminal, and powerful debugging capabilities make it a versatile and indispensable tool in my daily workflow.

### My Preferred Hypervisor: Proxmox VE

When it comes to virtualization, **Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE)** remains my preferred hypervisor above anything else. Its open-source nature, powerful features, ease of use, and the tight integration of both KVM for virtual machines and LXC for containers make it an incredibly versatile platform for my home lab and various testing environments. The web-based interface is intuitive, and the robust feature set allows for complex configurations and management with ease.

### Version Control and Collaboration: GitHub

For managing code, collaborating on projects, and keeping track of changes, **GitHub** is an essential platform in my daily workflow. Its intuitive interface, robust version control features with Git, and collaborative tools make it invaluable for both personal projects and any team-based development efforts.

### Containerization: Docker

While it might be considered an older technology by some, **Docker** remains a trusted and simple solution for containerization in my setup. Its ease of use for creating and managing lightweight, portable containers simplifies application deployment and ensures consistency across different environments. It's a fundamental tool for my development and testing workflows.

### Secure Remote Access: OpenVPN

For secure remote access to my home lab and other private networks, **OpenVPN** is my go-to solution. Its reliability and robust security features provide peace of mind when connecting from different locations, ensuring that my data and systems remain protected.

### System Monitoring: Zabbix

Keeping a close eye on the health and performance of my systems is crucial, and for that, I rely on **Zabbix**. This powerful monitoring solution provides comprehensive insights into server metrics, application performance, and potential issues, allowing me to proactively address problems before they impact my workflow.

### The Nostalgic File Manager: Midnight Commander

Sometimes, the classics are the best! **Midnight Commander** might be almost as old as myself, but this text-based file manager, reminiscent of Norton Commander, remains a beloved and highly efficient tool for navigating file systems directly in the terminal. Its speed and intuitive two-pane interface make many file management tasks quicker and easier than using a purely graphical interface.

### 3D Design and Printing: Blender and Tinkercad

For my 3D printing endeavors, I utilize both **Blender** and **Tinkercad** for design. Blender offers powerful and advanced modeling capabilities, while Tinkercad provides a more user-friendly and accessible entry point for simpler designs.

Whether using the official client or my self-hosted **Vaultwarden** instance, this open-source solution securely stores all my passwords and sensitive information, making it easy to generate strong, unique passwords and access them across all my devices.

### Smart Home Automation: Home Assistant

For managing and automating my smart home devices, **Home Assistant** is the central hub. Its open-source nature and extensive integrations allow me to create custom automations and control a wide range of devices from a single platform.

### Office Productivity: LibreOffice (Desktop) / Microsoft 365 (Web)

While my workplace primarily utilizes Microsoft 365, which I access via the web-based version on my Linux machines, I rely on the open-source **LibreOffice** suite directly on my laptop. It provides a comprehensive and free alternative for document creation, spreadsheets, and presentations when I prefer a native desktop application. LibreOffice integrates seamlessly with my Linux workflow and handles most of my personal productivity needs with ease.

### Secure Communication: Matrix

I'm in the process of migrating towards **Matrix** for secure and decentralized communication. Its open standard and end-to-end encryption are key factors in this decision, and I'm looking forward to leveraging its capabilities for more private conversations and potentially team communication in the future. For a more in-depth look at my thoughts on various messaging apps and my reasons for moving to Matrix, you can see my [post]({{< ref "posts/2025/03/a_critical_look_at_messaging_apps_signal_whatsapp_telegram_and_matrix/" >}}).

### Community communication: Discord

For connecting with communities, collaborating with others, and occasionally indulging in some gaming, **Discord** is my preferred platform. Its voice and text chat features, along with its server-based structure, make it a versatile tool for various online interactions.

### Personal Cloud and Collaboration: Nextcloud

For secure file storage, sharing, calendar, contacts, and much more, I run my own **Nextcloud** instance. It provides a private and feature-rich alternative to public cloud services, giving me complete control over my data.

### Ebook Management: Calibre

For managing my extensive ebook library, converting formats, and syncing with my e-reader, **Calibre** is an indispensable tool. This powerful open-source software makes organizing and enjoying my digital books a breeze.
