Hey, I’m the Nerd Behind Roethof.net!
{{< /typeit >}}


Hey there! Ask me what I do, and I’ll tell you I work with computers—the nerdy way. I’m a Linux admin for our company’s internal IT, with a passion for solving problems and automating the heck out of everything. This is my spot to geek out, share fixes, and chase the perfect setup.

### What I Do
I keep our company’s systems chugging along, mostly on Arch Linux now (after cracking my brain on FreeBSD and Debian). I’ve got a knack for unraveling tech messes—think scripting quick wins or automating workflows with Ansible to dodge the grind. Security’s in my wheelhouse too (I double as Security Officer, SysAdmin and pentester), but I’m happiest knee-deep in a terminal, not a boardroom. This site is where I dump my brainfarts—uh, I mean, share my solutions—hoping it spares you some grief.

### Why Open Source?
Open source is my fuel. It’s freedom to tweak, trust, and build—perfect for a guy who’d rather script than sleep. Arch, Ansible, Bash—you name it, I’m all in. This site’s my way to toss those solutions back into the wild for anyone who needs them.

### About This Site
Roethof.net is my unfiltered tech log. Expect rants on surviving sleep-deprived sysadmin nights, thoughts on security vs. usability (like company laptops for personal use), and my quest for a split keyboard to wrestle Tietze’s syndrome. It’s raw, practical, and straight from the terminal.

### A Bit More About Me
I’m always chasing the next puzzle, whether it’s streamlining a messy workflow, outsmarting a security snag, or finding the ultimate setup that doesn’t fight me back. Call it a nerd’s endless adventure. But to keep it short:

- **Tech Stack**: Arch Linux, Ansible, Bash, with FreeBSD and Debian scars—or should I say servers.
- **Drive**: Solving problems and automating *everything*, manual (IT) work is for suckers.
- **Family**: Father to an 11-year-old son—the joy of my life—and lucky fiancé to an amazing partner who keeps me grounded amidst the tech chaos.
- **My Epic Quest (Still Loading...)**: To boldly go where no sysadmin has gone before... just kidding (mostly!). Seriously though, it's all about leveling up my tech skills, constantly diving into new nerdy rabbit holes, and building cool stuff along the way. The learning never stops!
- **My Nerd Mantra**: "Automate the boring bits so you have more brainpower for the awesome bits."  and "If it’s not automated, is it even worth doing?"


### Get in Touch
Got a tech riddle that’s stumping you, an automation hack to brag about, or a keyboard tip to save my sanity and health? Drop me a line at [ronny@roethof.net](mailto:ronny@roethof.net)—I’m always up for a nerdy chat or a debug session. Think you’ve spotted a glitch in my setup? Go ahead, tease me about it—I dare you to prove me wrong, because I strive to perfect it! Whether you’re here to geek out, swap ideas, or just poke fun at my latest brainfart, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s keep this tech sandbox playful and chaotic in all the right ways!
