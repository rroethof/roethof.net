## Lyrics
[Verse]  
Armor of Linux  
My freedom's domain  
Privacy's sacred  
I'll bear the pain  
Commands in the terminal  
Cold and black  
The sysadmin's vengeance  
I counterattack  

[Chorus]  
Burn the chains  
Break their reign  
Bare metal warrior  
I remain  
Lines of code  
My weapon  
My creed  
Against the giants  
They'll concede  

[Verse]  
FOSS runs deep  
In my blood it flows  
A digital rebellion  
The fire it shows  
Microsoft trembles  
Their power I fight  
Freedom's banner flies high in the night  

[Bridge]  
Truth is my sword  
Resilience my shield  
My terms  
My code  
I will never yield  
Against the corruption  
I march and I yell  
In the realm of binaries  
Give 'em hell!  

[Chorus]  
Burn the chains  
Break their reign  
Bare metal warrior  
I remain  
Lines of code  
My weapon  
My creed  
Against the giants  
They'll concede  

[Verse]  
EU's grasp  
Invasive they crawl  
Surveillance servers  
I shatter them all  
Root access earned  
No puppet  
No pawn  
The age of control  
Soon it is gone
