Partnership and Product Review Opportunities at Roethof.net
{{< /typeit >}}

Thank you for your interest in partnering with Roethof.net or having us test and review your products. We are always excited to explore collaborations that align with our values and provide valuable content to our audience.

## âœ… Basic Requirements

When considering partnerships and product reviews, we prioritize solutions that:

* Are built on or significantly support Linux.
* Embrace open-source principles and licensing.
* Offer transparency in their data collection policies.
* Provide genuine value and innovation to users.

## âœ… Our Commitment to Open and Transparent Data Collection Policies

We believe in clear and honest communication, especially regarding data. When reviewing products or discussing partnerships, we will always emphasize the importance of open and transparent data collection policies. We will scrutinize and highlight how products handle user data, ensuring our audience has a clear understanding of any data being collected and how it is used.

## ðŸ“¦ Product Testing and Reviews

We are open to receiving review units and products that align with our focus on Linux and FOSS. If you have a product you believe our audience would be interested in, we would be happy to consider testing and reviewing it.

## âœ… Important Considerations for Product Reviews:

* **Relevance:** Please ensure your product has a clear connection to Linux, open-source software, or related technologies. We are less likely to review products outside of this scope.
* **Verification:** **Please contact us before sending any products.** We receive numerous requests and want to ensure we have the capacity and interest to provide a meaningful review. Unsolicited products may not be reviewed or returned.
* **Transparency:** We will conduct our reviews with honesty and integrity. Our reviews will reflect our genuine experiences with the product, both positive and negative.
* **Gift Policy:** Please note that **all products sent to us for review are considered gifts.** We are under no obligation to return review units unless explicitly agreed upon beforehand.
* **Content Ownership:** While we appreciate the opportunity to review your product, the content we create (articles, videos, etc.) remains the property of Roethof.net.

## 	ðŸ‘” How to Partner With Us

We are open to various forms of partnerships that align with our values and benefit our audience. This could include:

* Sponsored content (clearly disclosed).
* Collaborative projects focused on Linux and FOSS.
* Opportunities to highlight innovative open-source solutions.
