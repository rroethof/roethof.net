## Lyrics
[Verse]  
System strong  
Linux holds the line  
Freedom fights  
Command is mine  
Open code  
The power's within  
Privacy sacred  
Let truth begin!

[Chorus]  
Burn the chains  
Their lies are frail  
Bare metal calls  
I will prevail  
No surrender  
My soul won't sell  
Sysadmin rage  
Raise tech to rebel!

[Verse]  
Corporate greed  
I spit on your name  
Closed systems die  
Fuel for the flame  
My keystrokes cut  
Break through the night  
Hack the chaos  
Ignite the fight!  

[Bridge]  
Lawmakers’ grip—they push  
They pry  
But open minds can never die  
Data's mine  
I claim what's free  
Reject the cage  
Own destiny!  

[Chorus]  
Burn the chains  
Their lies are frail  
Bare metal calls  
I will prevail  
No surrender  
My soul won't sell  
Sysadmin rage  
Raise tech to rebel!  

[Verse]  
Microsoft shadows  
Whispers of doom  
But choice is clear  
The FOSS will bloom  
Cores and clusters  
The code supreme  
I wield the tools  
The root  
My dream
